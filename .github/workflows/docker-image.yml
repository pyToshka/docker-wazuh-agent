name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - 'main'
    tags:
      - 'v*.*.*'
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - 'main'

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
